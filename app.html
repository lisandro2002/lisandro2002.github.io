            <h2 width: 15%;> For the final project, Jake Murphy and I created a game that is very similar to Flappy Game. However, it has some differences; one of the most significant examples is that the tubes are not static on the y-axis; instead, they’re randomly placed on the y-axis. Another change is instead of using a bird as Flappy Bird. We decided to use my bitmoji that changes shirt color(from red to blue) whenever the bitmoji is going up or down. To play the game is very simple as the user would be received on the splash screen of the game, which shows both bitmoji that we created throughout the semester. In between the bitmojis, the user can click on the button “play,” which would transition the user to the playing scene. The user would have my bitmoji as the main character to play the game on the playing scene. To go up, the user can click the space bar on their computer, and to go down, they can release the space bar. Lastly, the objective of the game is to go through the tubes without colliding into the tubes. For every top and bottom tubes, the user would accumulate one point into the user end the game throughout a collispion or exit the game.
