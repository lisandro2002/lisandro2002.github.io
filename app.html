            <center><h3>For the final project, Jake Murphy and I created a game that is very similar to Flappy Game. <br> However, it has some differences; one of the most significant examples is that the tubes<br> are not static on the y-axis; instead, they’re randomly placed on the y-axis. Another <br>change is instead of using a bird as Flappy Bird. We decided to use my bitmoji that changes <br> shirt color(from red to blue) whenever the bitmoji is going up or down. To play the game is very simple as <br> the user would be received on the splash screen of the game, which shows both bitmoji that <br> we created throughout the semester. In between the bitmojis, the <br> user can click on the button “play,” which would transition the user to the playing scene. The<br> user would have my bitmoji as the main character to play the game on the playing <br> scene. To go up, the user can click the space bar on their computer, and to go down, they can<br> release the space bar. Lastly, the objective of the game is to go through the <br> tubes without colliding into the tubes. For every top and bottom tubes, the user would accumulate<br>  one point into the user end the game throughout a collispion or exit the game.
